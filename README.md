## üìã Project Overview

Kastoma is a scalable e-commerce API built with Django REST Framework, designed for modern web and mobile applications requiring robust product catalog management, user authentication, and order processing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

### Core Framework Choices

- **Django REST Framework**: Comprehensive API toolkit with built-in serialization, pagination, and filtering
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication suitable for mobile apps and SPAs
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL + SQLite**: Flexible database support for development and production environments
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for consistent environments across development and production

### Project Structure Rationale

```
kastoma_backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/           # Environment-specific configurations (dev/prod separation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/               # Versioned API routing (v1, future v2/v3)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ v1/               # API version 1 endpoints and logic
```

**Why this structure:**
- **Settings package**: Separates development and production configurations for better security
- **API versioning**: Enables backward compatibility when introducing breaking changes
- **Modular routing**: Clean separation between API versions and business logic

### Application Architecture

```
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # Shared utilities, health checks, and base functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/             # Custom user model with email authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ products/          # Product catalog with categories, variants, and reviews
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orders/            # Order management and shopping cart functionality
```

**Design principles:**
- **Single responsibility**: Each app handles one business domain
- **Custom user model**: Email-based authentication instead of username for better UX
- **Extensible product system**: Supports variants, images, and customer reviews
- **Health monitoring**: Built-in health checks for production monitoring

## üîß Configuration Management

### Environment-Based Settings

- **Base settings**: Common configurations shared across all environments
- **Development settings**: Debug mode, console email backend, permissive CORS
- **Production settings**: Security hardening, file logging, database connection pooling

**Why separate settings:**
- Security isolation between environments
- Easy deployment configuration management
- Development productivity without compromising production security

### Key Configuration Features

- **Environment variables**: Sensitive data managed through environment variables
- **JWT configuration**: Configurable token lifetimes and security settings
- **CORS management**: Flexible cross-origin resource sharing for frontend integration
- **Logging system**: Structured logging with file rotation for production monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT tokens**: Stateless authentication with configurable expiration
- **Permission classes**: Role-based access control for different user types
- **Password validation**: Django's built-in password strength validation
- **HTTPS enforcement**: Configurable SSL/TLS security headers

### Production Security

- **Security middleware**: XSS protection, content type sniffing prevention
- **CORS configuration**: Restricted origins for production environments
- **Database security**: Connection pooling and SQL injection protection
- **Static file security**: Proper handling of static assets in production

## üìä API Design Philosophy

### RESTful Principles

- **Resource-based URLs**: Clear, intuitive endpoint structure
- **HTTP methods**: Proper use of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- **Status codes**: Meaningful HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets

### API Features

- **Filtering**: Advanced product filtering by price, category, availability
- **Search**: Full-text search across product names and descriptions
- **Sorting**: Flexible ordering of results
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

## üîç Development Tools & Quality

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: Ruff for fast Python linting and formatting
- **Code formatting**: Black for consistent code style
- **Import sorting**: isort for organized imports
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated code quality checks before commits

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Model, serializer, and business logic testing
- **Integration tests**: API endpoint testing with authentication
- **Coverage reporting**: Comprehensive test coverage tracking
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows

## üöÄ Deployment & Operations

### Containerization

- **Multi-stage Docker**: Optimized image builds with separate build and runtime stages
- **Docker Compose**: Development and production environment orchestration
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health monitoring

### Production Features

- **Health endpoints**: `/health/`, `/health/detailed/`, `/health/ready/`, `/health/live/`
- **Static file handling**: Efficient static asset serving with WhiteNoise
- **Database migrations**: Safe, automated database schema updates
- **Logging**: Structured logging with file rotation and error tracking

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Health monitoring**: Multiple health check endpoints for different monitoring needs
- **Error tracking**: Optional Sentry integration for error reporting
- **Performance monitoring**: Database query optimization and response time tracking
- **Security monitoring**: Authentication failure tracking and rate limiting

## üì± API Endpoints
